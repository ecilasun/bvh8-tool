# BVH8 Tool

A tool to generate simple BVH8 structures out of raw triangles


# Summary

This tool will read a list of raw triangle vertices, and generate a BVH8 structure around it. For a BVH8, each node has up to 8 child nodes, and the structure is encoded so that the hardware on E32E can work comfortably with it.

# BVH8 Layout

TBD
